# Extended Markdown
Extend the capabilities of Markdown with diagrams and LaTeX.

### Work in Progress :wrench:

The goal of this project is to process *Extended Markdown* files (`.mdx`) into *Markdown* files (`.md`). This extension adds useful capabilities such as:
- [ ] Graph diagrams
- [ ] Block LaTeX rendering
- [ ] Inline LaTex rendering (i.e. `$y = mx + b$ is a rational function!` )
